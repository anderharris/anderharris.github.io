            An open-source bionic leg has been developed by the Michigan Engineering group and had its details made available freely online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Elliot Rouse and his colleagues at the University of Michigan have developed the world's first open-source bionic leg, with the intention of making
            prosthetic legs more affordable for both biomedical researchers and patients. This artificial limb comes with step-by-step guides on both assembly and 
            operation, so that it remains both easy to understand and use. By creating the open-source leg, this will hopefully lead to improvements in biomedical
            research and treatment by reducing the investment needed by both researchers and patients to obtain or create their variant of the open-source bionic leg.
        </p>

            One of the most unique design choices for this bionic leg is the use of 'brushless electric motors' for the knee and ankle joints. These motors, while
            slower, are more efficient and precise with their movements. Through this design, patients and testers will have an easier time using the prosthetic
            as less force is exerted when moving the leg. The knee and ankle joints have independent motors; this allows for more complex movements to be 
            executed through finer control of the leg. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, reception by testers of the bionic leg have been positive. Physical therapists stated that volunteers were able to meet all goals set by them
