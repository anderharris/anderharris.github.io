            An open-source bionic leg has been developed by the Michigan Engineering group and had its details made available freely online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Elliot Rouse and his colleagues at the University of Michigan have developed the world's first open-source bionic leg, with the intention of making
            prosthetic legs more affordable for both biomedical researchers and patients. This artificial limb comes with step-by-step guides on both assembly and 
            operation, so that it remains both easy to understand and use. By creating the open-source leg, this will hopefully lead to improvements in biomedical
            research and treatment by reducing the investment needed by both researchers and patients to obtain or create their variant of the open-source bionic leg.
