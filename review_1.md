Interest of Content
====================
Weak<br>
The second and third page have good content but the first page is just filler text.


Consistency and quality of visual presentation
====================
Sound<br>
The navbar is good and consistent and most of the pages have good presentation individually but there isn't much consistentcy in style between them.


Quality of written presentation
====================
Good<br>
Some of the website has great written presentation but other bits aren't as good.

Validity of HTML
====================
Good<br>
Most of it is valid but there are some issues including tags not being closed, two head tags in environment.html, etc. (there are comments in the HTML)

Evidence of collaboration including
====================
Author info not written by author
--------------------
Unacceptable<br>
There isn't author info written other than the name of the author. All of the Github and LinkedIn links don't lead anywhere and the environment.html author info is written by the author.

Balanced contributions from members
--------------------
Weak<br>
There are 4 members of the team but only 3 files. Adrien only made 1 commit changing a header. The level of effort varies across the pages.

Not completed at the last minute
--------------------
Very Good<br>
A lot of commits were last Friday and a lot were yesterday with a few inbetween so it wasn't all rushed at the last minute but quite a lot was done the day before.
