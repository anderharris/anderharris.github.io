i. Content mostly interesting except the filler text on index page. Good

ii. Very good graphical presentation but inconsistent between pages. Headers not same size and one page without header. Very good

iii. Written presentation great standard. Excellent

iv. Only 2 minor issues with index page HTML validity. No language tag added and character encoding not specified. The other pages also have the same issues with character encoding and language tag. Environment page has double head tag and p element not used but p end tag seen. Biomedical page has the most issues. No space between attributes, Attribute “,” is not serialisable as XML 1.0, Attribute “,” not allowed on element “img” at this point, End tag for “body” seen, but there were unclosed elements, Unclosed element “div”. Acceptable

v. Author info not written by author. Each group member contributed and not done at last minute. Excellent
